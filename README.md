# ImmersiveColors
When MS released Windows 8, they introduced a new feature called **ImmerciveColors**. Based on your OS settings (wallpapers or color set) you may have a sets of colors that can be used to draw your UI. However this feature is not a quite known for the public since itâ€™s still undocumented (even with Windows 10). So I wrote this simple project to demonstrate how to benefit from this feature.

##Features:
-	Easy access to Windows theme colors.
-	[Getting Active color set](https://github.com/MahdiSafsafi/ImmersiveColors/wiki#getting-active-color-set).
-	Enumerating color type names.
-	[Retrieve color value based on color type](https://github.com/MahdiSafsafi/ImmersiveColors/wiki#accessing-immersive-colors).
-	[Notified when system changes Immersive settings](https://github.com/MahdiSafsafi/ImmersiveColors/wiki#get-notified-when-user-changes-immersive-colors-settings).
